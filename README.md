# Exercise 1.19 - Simple calculator

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Two examples of the execution of the program are given below.

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*8*
Give the second number:
*2*
8 + 2 = 10
8 - 2 = 6
8 * 2 = 16
8 / 2 = 4.0
```

```plaintext
Give the first number:
*9*
Give the second number:
*2*
9 + 2 = 11
9 - 2 = 7
9 * 2 = 18
9 / 2 = 4.5
```
